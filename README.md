Android Studio:
Minimum requirement of the application was to display the capacity zone of the bus. 
The Progress Bar, Notification Push,Text/Progress bar's changing colors and Applications Icon were all added to build a good looking and Practical application. 
1) Main activity.Java is where all of the processing for input and outtakes place. The APi.JAVA file is responsile for using Retrofit Lib and connected the application to the Database and calling the PHP file which fetches JSon data. 
2) Android studio libraries were used for including a Progress bar, Sending Notification to notification bar and using RetroFit.
3) The application is responsible to checks if user's input is a supported bus number else the user is returned an error and user can input a correct bus number. 
4) Depending on the Bus's Current Capacity zone, the process bar's color and length changes for visual aid and a notification is also sent to the user if the bus is in havey traffic zone.
5) I tried to include OC Transport's API but could not finish in time for demo. So the destination of the Bus was hard coded in the application and is NOT Live.
